<p>1. Improved data sharing:
The DBMS helps create an environment in which end users have better access to more and better-managed data.
Such access makes it possible for end users to respond quickly to changes in their environment.
2. Improved data security:
The more users access the data, the greater the risks of data security breaches.Corporations invest considerable amounts of time, effort, and money to ensure that corporate data are used properly.
A DBMS provides a framework for better enforcement of data privacy and security policies.
3. Better data integration:
Wider access to well-managed data promotes an integrated view of the organization’s operations and a clearer view of the big picture.
It becomes much easier to see how actions in one segment of the company affect other segments.
4. Minimized data inconsistency:
Data inconsistency exists when different versions of the same data appear in different places.
For example, data inconsistency exists when a company’s sales department stores a sales representative’s name as “Bill Brown” and the company’s personnel department stores that same person’s name as “William G. Brown,” or when the company’s regional sales office shows the price of a product as $45.95 and its national sales office shows the same product’s price as $43.95.
The probability of data inconsistency is greatly reduced in a properly designed database.
5. Improved data access:
The DBMS makes it possible to produce quick answers to ad hoc queries.
From a database perspective, a query is a specific request issued to the DBMS for data manipulation—for example, to read or update the data. Simply put, a query is a question, and an ad hoc query is a spur-of-the-moment question.
The DBMS sends back an answer (called the query result set) to the application.
For example, end users
6. Improved decision making:
Better-managed data and improved data access make it possible to generate better-quality information, on which better decisions are based.
The quality of the information generated depends on the quality of the underlying data.
Data quality is a comprehensive approach to promoting the accuracy, validity, and timeliness of the data. While the DBMS does not guarantee data quality, it provides a framework to facilitate data quality initiatives.
Increased end-user productivity
The availability of data, combined with the tools that transform data into usable information, empowers end users to make quick, informed decisions that can make the difference between success and failure in the global economy.<p>
